### To Do
- [x] Move US HQ to park area
- [x] Modify US HQ spawn points
- [x] Add spawn points to new flags
- [ ] Create replacement redzone texture asset (not possible yet)
- [ ] Add alpha vehicles

### Known Issues / Bugs
* The combat area asset on the minimap had to be removed as it can't be changed to reflect the new combat area yet
* ~~Duplicate flag icons sometimes appear above the minimap~~ - Fixed in `0.0.4`
* ~~The capture label that usually appears at the center of the screen whilst a player is capturing a point sometimes doesn't move to the center of the screen~~ - Fixed in `0.0.4`
